In order to properly run this project, you'll have install tachyons through Git as well as install a blank react app you can then load these files into
Unfortunately GitHub will not allow me to include these necessary files myself because the files are too large
to install a react app: 
npm create-react-app my-app
you will need the node_modules folder, otherwise you can clear out necessary files before downloading the github zip folder

to install tachyons:
git clone https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons.git
cd tachyons 
npm install
