You will need to manually install tachyons for the CSS attributes because the tachyon file is too large for me to be able to upload to GitHub

to install tachyons: 
git clone 

https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons.git

cd tachyons

npm install

This project is a simple database search engine, this was designed with the intention of finding something by name and displaying other information relevant to that name
such as a picture or information about that target. This particular design is very smooth and searches as you type rather than searching after you type what you're
looking for.
